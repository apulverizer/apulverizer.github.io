                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p> I was born and raised in the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of Western New York. 
                        Growing up I spent a lot of time hiking, camping, skiing, biking, and kayaking with my family. 
                        I took a special interest in hiking, and in true peak bagger fashion became an Adirondack 46-er, 
                        and successfully thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail. I obtained my B.S. in Computer Engineering at 
                        the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2014. It was during the final semesters of my 
                        undergraduate education I developed a passion for GIS since it allowed me to combine my 
                        programming expertise, my desire to solve problems, my love of maps, and my passion for 
                        the outdoors. This is ultimately what led me to pursue a Master’s Degree in Geography at the 
                        University of Utah. I work in the <a href="http://digit.utah.edu">DIGIT Lab</a> performing a range of tasks from editing geospatial 
                        data to building custom web applications. My main research uses GIS and location modeling to explore 
                        the feasibility of medical drones. Me, my fiancé, and our dog enjoy exploring everything Utah’s 
                        wilderness has to offer.

                        changes. A map book was also developed which shows sections of the trail and key attributes along the way.</p>

                    <h2>My Research</h2>
                    <p>
                    Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) is prevalent in the United States. Each year several hundred-thousand people die due to cardiac arrest. 
                    The automated external defibrillator (AED) has greatly enhanced survival rates for OOHCA. However, one of the most important factors in successful 
                    resuscitation is emergency medical services (EMS) response time. Unmanned aerial vehicles have routinely been used for remote sensing but there are 
                    new opportunities to use drones for medical emergencies. The objective of my research is examine spatial variation in cardiac arrest incidence rates 
                    in Salt Lake County and to provide a framework for locating a network of AED enabled drones to significantly reduce response times and therefore 
                    increase survival rates for OOHCAs. I've worked with my advisor to develop a new location model to determine the most cost-effective way to cover 90% of the demand for 
                    cardiac arrest medical service within one minute and five minute standards. The demand for service was derived from empirical OOHCA incident 
                    data. <p>
                    I heavily use GIS and Python to determine the demand and potential facilities. Once the demand and potential areas are determined, we can apply models
                    such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_coverage_problem">MCLP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem">LSCP</a> to 
                    determine the optimal configuration of drones. The models are then solved using Gurobi, a mathmatical programming solver. Results can then 
                    be mapped and analyzed. In the process of my thesis, I've been developing <a href="https://github.com/apulverizer/pyspatialopt">pyspatialopt</a>, an python library for spatial optimization.
