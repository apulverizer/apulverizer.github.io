  Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm a Principal Product Engineer on the Field Operations team at Esri. My background is in software development and GIS. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, playing board games and hanging out with my family. In 2014, I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail, from Maine to Georgia. Iâ€™ve also climbed the 115 4,000+ foot mountains in New England.
