  Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm a Principal Product Engineer at Esri with a background in software engineering and GIS. I'm most skilled in the ArcGIS platform (Online, Enterprise, APIs), Python development, web development, and automated testing.

  I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, playing board games and hanging out with my family. In 2014, I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail, from Maine to Georgia. Iâ€™ve also climbed the 115 4,000+ foot mountians in New England.
