                    <h3><a href="lowaltitude/paper.pdf">PDF</a></h3>
                    <p>
                    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have routinely been used for aerial imagery collection and military purposes (Everaerts 2008). Recently UAVs or drones, as they are more commonly referred to by the public, have become increasingly popular in commercial business. Amazon, for example, has been developing drones to deliver packages to customers (Misener 2014). In addition to commercial applications, drones may be equipped to transport medical supplies such as blood derivatives and pharmaceuticals to hospitals, remote areas, and mass causality incidents (Thiels et al. 2015). In addition to transporting medical supplies, drones may have the ability to provide other medical treatments. In 2014, a prototype medical drone equipped with an AED was announced (Communication 2014). This particular drone can fly at speeds up to 100 km/h and can be deployed by emergency dispatchers at a moment’s notice (Husten 2014). The drone flies to the patient using cell phone GPS coordinates as a target. Upon reaching the target, the dispatcher, through real-time video and audio, can instruct the bystander to use the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) on the patient. Since medical drones can travel faster than traditional ground transport EMS vehicles, they provide the capacity to drastically reduce travel time and overall response times for time-critical emergencies. Drones have limited range and in order to minimize response times, a network of multiple drones is required to adequately provide service to a large area.
                    <p>
                    Drones can be outfitted with several different sensors, cameras, and onboard microprocessors to autonomously self-stabilize, follow given paths, and detect and avoid obstacles (Jimenez Lugo and Zell 2013). Computer vision and machine learning algorithms have been developed and experimentally tested to successfully navigate drones  in narrow environments and in areas where GPS signals are non-existent (Jimenez Lugo and Zell 2013; Mercado, Castillo, and Lozano 2015; Krajnik et al. 2012). Although drones have the capabilities to fly autonomously and avoid obstacles, these obstacles may significantly reduce the estimated response times. This study uses Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data to locate obstacles and to determine their effect on medical drone service ranges at low altitudes (1-30m).

                    A subsection of Salt Lake City was chosen as the study area. Four contiguous sections of LIDAR data were download from the Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC). AGRC provides 0.5m resolution LIDAR datasets in the form of Digital Surface Models (DSM) and Digital Terrain Models (DTM). The average vertical accuracy is 0.04 meters. The DSM was generated using a TINing process as described in the metadata. In addition to the LIDAR data, EMS stations were geocoded from the Utah Department of Health using the Utah road network dataset provided by AGRC.

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <p>
                    This study breaks the problem of locating obstacles into two categories: locating buildings, and locating trees. Both of these obstacles were considered large enough that they may significantly increase travel times as drones fly around or above them. In comparison telephone poles and small shrubs should not significantly alter a drone’s optimal route. 
                    <h3>Detecting Buildings</h3>
                    <p>
                    Several methods have been proposed to detect buildings using LIDAR as well as ancillary data such as NDVI. Demir et al. (2008) compared four different methods of building detection. The first method relies on combining NDVI data with the normalized DSM. The second method used supervised classification method based on a normalized DSM. The third method used the raw point cloud density in conjunction with NDVI data. The final and most successful method uses the vertical density of raw DSM LIDAR data. Morphological image processing has also been used to detect buildings using LIDAR data (Meng, Wang, and Currit 2009). 
                    <p>
                    I used an approach based on Ekhari et al. (2008) and Rottensteiner et al. (2002) where the DSM was subtracted from the DTM resulting in a normalized DSM. The slope of the normalized DSM was taken and classified into two categories: “Low-Rise” (0 to 15cm), and “High-Rise” (greater than 15cm). Then a morphological fill operation was performed to remove small holes. The resulting pixels were then converted to polygons. Polygons less than 50 square meters in area were removed. Finally, bounding boxes were found for each remaining polygon; this simplifies the geometry to rectangles which reduces future computation time.  The analysis was performed using ArcGIS and the provided arcpy Python library.

                    <h3>Detecting Trees</h3>
                    <p>
                    Several methods have been proposed to both detect and delineate individual trees. Demir et al. (2008) analyzed the vertical density of DSM data to detect clusters representing trees. Koch et al. (2006) used a local maxima filter in conjunction with a pouring algorithm to delineate individual tree crowns. Rahman and Gorte (2008) used an inverse watershed algorithm, which is similar to the pouring algorithm, to delineate individual tree crowns. Although these approaches work well, they are computationally expensive and complex.
                    <p>
                    This study uses a combination surface roughness analysis and morphological image processing to detect trees. The first step was to compute the normalized DSM by subtracting the DSM from the DTM. The slope of the normalized DSM was then taken, detecting the percent rise rather than the traditional degree measurement. The slope was then classified into low (0-100 percent) and high (over 100 percent) groups. The high slopes, generally represent pixels that have significant variation which is indicative of vegetation. The normalized DSM was also classified into low (0-1 meters) objects and high objects (over 1 meter). The high objects normalized DSM raster was intersected with the high slopes raster resulting in raster showing possible trees. The raster was then filtered using a median filter with a kernel size of. Since the input raster is binary, the median filter acts as a majority filter, and removes small groups of pixels and outlying pixels that are considered too small to be trees, resulting in a raster depicting trees. The majority of the analysis was performed in ArcGIS using the arcpy library, however the image filtering was performed using scipy, a scientific Python library containing image processing functions.

                    <h3>Determining Service Areas</h3>
                    <p>
                    Service areas, represent the areas that can be served within a prescribed time or distance threshold. These were determined by ORing the binary raster of building pixels and the binary raster of tree pixels to form a new raster representing obstacles. Current EMS locations were converted from points to raster pixels. The Path-Distance tool in ArcGIS was used to calculate the distance from each EMS pixel to each blank pixel in the obstacle raster. It is important to note that this algorithm only considers “Queens” movements meaning that a path must go through the center of pixels rather than just crossing a section of the pixel. This means that distance calculated does not accurately represent the distance that a drone would fly. It is over-estimated.

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                    As seen below, the majority of buildings were successfully detected. Since a ground-truth dataset of buildings was not available, no accuracy statistics are provided. However, by examining the aerial imagery, some errors can be found. As seen in the center of Figure 3, there is a section of grass that is classified as a building. This is the result of the bounding box, which assumes that all buildings are rectangular. There are very few false positives (detecting a building when a building is not present), and some false negatives (a building that should have been detected but was not).
                    <p>
                    Trees were also successfully detected. Unfortunately, there was no ground-truth tree data to compare my results with. However, by examining Figure 4, most trees appear to be detected. Since the aerial imagery and the LIDAR data do not match up temporally, it is difficult to tell if there are over-estimates or under-estimates of trees. There are some small polygons that clearly do not represent trees but generally they represent small obstacles on or near buildings. 
                    <p>
                    The derived service areas are shown below. Greener areas represent areas closer to EMS stations. Black areas represent areas that were served before obstacles were included in the generation of service areas. There is a clear reduction in the range of service of medical drones when obstacles are avoided. It is worth noting that it is unlikely that a drone will maintain top speed as it avoids obstacles, leading to an over-estimation of the distance a drone can fly within 1 minute.
                    <p>
                    The figure below shows estimated paths taken by a drone flown a few meters off of the ground from three EMS stations to 3 simulated incidents. The yellow lines, are the ideal naïve paths that do not consider any obstacles. The red lines show the paths taken by drones to avoid trees and buildings. As expected, each path that considered obstacles resulted in a longer flight distance (Table 1). In best case scenarios, such as flying along a road, the difference is negligible since there are few, if any obstacles. However, in most cases, the drone will have to fly around trees and buildings experiencing a significant drop in service coverage.

                    <h2>Discussion & Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                    LIDAR data were successfully used to classify low altitude obstacles as either trees, buildings, or neither. The classification results were verified using aerial imagery and despit some misclassifications, trees and buildings were sucessfully detected. Service areas were derived which specifically avoid the detected obstacles. Based on the above figures and table, obstacles signficantly affect the range of medical drones. It is worth noting that in many cases the drones will be flying above the trees and buildings, however obstacles may affect potential landing and take-off zone, and short range trips. This study can be improved in several ways. First, using more advanced image processing filters can probably reduce the amout of misclassifications and provide a better set of obstacles. Secondly, using a better algorithm to determine service areas that does not rely on “Queens” movements will provide better travel distance and time estimates. For example, visiblity graphs could be generated and then shortest path algorithms such as Dijsktra and A* could be used to determine more optimal flight paths. Although  there is room for improvement, the methodologies used in this study were successful and provided meaningful results.
