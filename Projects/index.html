                        <p> I am a graduate student at the University of Utah studying GIS and Geography. I have a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering and 
                        enjoy combining my programming skills with GIS to create custom scripts, interactive map-based web applications, and interesting visualizations.
                        I'm profficient with Python (2&3), R, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I also have significant experience with C++, C#, and MATLAB. I've completed 
                        software development internships at <a href="http://www.gleason.com/">The Gleason Works</a>, <a href="http://www.lenovo.com">Lenovo</a>, and <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>.
                        I currently work in the <a href="http://digit.utah.edu">DIGIT</a> lab at the University of Utah performing GIS tasks and developing software.

                    <h2>My Research</h2>
                    <p>
                    Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) is prevalent in the United States. Each year several hundred-thousand people die due to cardiac arrest. 
                    The automated external defibrillator (AED) has greatly enhanced survival rates for OOHCA. However, one of the most important factors in successful 
                    resuscitation is emergency medical services (EMS) response time. Unmanned aerial vehicles have routinely been used for remote sensing but there are 
                    new opportunities to use drones for medical emergencies. The objective of my research is examine spatial variation in cardiac arrest incidence rates 
                    in Salt Lake County and to provide a framework for locating a network of AED enabled drones to significantly reduce response times and therefore 
                    increase survival rates for OOHCAs. I've worked with my advisor to develop a new location model to determine the most cost-effective way to cover 90% of the demand for 
                    cardiac arrest medical service within one minute and five minute standards. The demand for service was derived from empirical OOHCA incident 
                    data. <p>
                    I heavily use GIS and Python to determine the demand and potential facilities. Once the demand and potential areas are determined, we can apply models
                    such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_coverage_problem">MCLP</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_cover_problem">LSCP</a> to 
                    determine the optimal configuration of drones. The models are then solved using Gurobi, a mathmatical programming solver. Results can then 
                    be mapped and analyzed.
