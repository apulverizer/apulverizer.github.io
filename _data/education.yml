    During my time at at the U of U, I researched how drones could be used to deliver emergency medical supplies such as AEDs to patients. I primarily focused on the spatial aspects of where drones should be located to provide optimal coverage. You can find my thesis [here](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/details?id=1345123&fd=title_t%2Cauthor_t%2Cdescription_t%2Cdepartment_t&rows=200&sort=modified_tdt+asc&facet_department_t=%22Geography%22&facet_school_or_college_t=%22College+of+Social+%26+Behavioral+Science%22&facet_setname_s=ir_etd). I also co-authored a few papers while at the U

    At RIT, I started off studying Electrical Engineering but eventually switched to Computer Engineering to focus more on Computer Science and software development. In my final year at RIT, I took a GIS course and that eventually lead me to pursue my masters degree at the University of Utah.
