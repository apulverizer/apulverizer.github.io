    I'm the product owner for [Tracker for ArcGIS](doc.arcgis.com/en/tracker/) and work with developers and fellow engineers to design, build, and test iOS, Android, and web apps for the Field Operations team at Esri.

    Additionally I develop automated UI tests using Python, Ruby, Selenium, Appium, and Cucumber/Behave. I'm responsible for developing and maintaining many Python [scripts](https://github.com/Esri/workforce-scripts), [notebooks](https://github.com/Esri/tracker-scripts), and [tools](https://github.com/Esri/collector-tools) for internal and customer use including the [Workforce](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.apps.workforce.html) and [Tracker](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.apps.tracker.html) module in the ArcGIS API for Python.
    
    I previously worked on the Operations Dashboard team doing design, QA, and automated testing.

    I later joined the [DIGIT Lab](https://digit.utah.edu/) as a software developer and GIS technician. I developed custom web applications for clients. I also wrote scripts to automate routine GIS and administrative tasks. I performed spatial and non spatial data analysis with ArcGIS Desktop, Python, and R.
